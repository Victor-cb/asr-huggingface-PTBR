Creating a Wav2Vec2 model for PT-Br

# Data

1. Mozilla Common Voice - PT-Br:
2. 134 hours of validated audio and transcriptions
3. 2.453 voices

# Model 

The idea was to use a [Wav2Vec2](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/wav2vec-20-learning-the-structure-of-speech-from-raw-audio/) model and finetune it.

### All the steps will be placed on the notebook, to achieve a Wer -> 0.0141 others technincs were used. The model, results and the API can be found on the [HuggingFace*REPO* - Victor](https://huggingface.co/Vkt/first_model)

On the HF-Repo you can try by yourself loading a pre-recorded audio or using the Realtime Speech Recognition! Have Fun :D
